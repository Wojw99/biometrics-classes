# biometrics-classes
A couple of different sources for learning and implementing biometrics solutions, prepared for biometric classes of the academy.

## What is Biometrics? 
[thalesgroup.com](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/inspired/biometrics) - the article in a short way describes the topic of biometrics. We can read about:
- definition
- trends
- biometric identifiers
- use cases (law, civil Identity, healthcare, etc.)
- biometrics market
- latest news

#### What is a biometrics?
"Biometrics is the most suitable means of identifying and authenticating individuals in a reliable and fast way through unique biological characteristics."

#### Where is biometrics used?
"Historically, applications using biometrics have been initiated by authorities for military access control, criminal or civil identification under a tightly regulated legal and technical framework. Today, sectors, including banking, retail, and mobile commerce, demonstrate a real appetite for the benefits of biometrics."

#### The biometrics market
"According to Global Markets Insights, the global biometric market is expected to top USD 50 billion by 2024. Non-AFIS will account for the highest biometrics market share, exceeding USD 18 billion by 2024. Biometric applications in the security and government sectors of North America are driving the regional market trends. The study claims, North America, with the U.S. at the helm, will represent more than 30% of the overall biometrics industry share by 2024. "
